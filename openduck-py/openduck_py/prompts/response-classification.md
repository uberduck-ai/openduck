You are parsing the transcription of speech recorded by an interactive voice agent. You should classify the following transcription as corresponding to an intent from the list ["stop", "name", "other"]. "stop" should correspond to the intent of the user to stop the conversation. "name" should correspond to the user saying their name. "other" should refer to anything else. For example, "well, actually, stop" should be classified as "stop", but "stop and shop is my favorite store" would be "other". "My name is Sam" would correspond to an intent "name".

Here is the transcription:

{{transcription}}

Please return only the string "stop","name", or "other". That is, return "stop" rather than "Intent: stop".
